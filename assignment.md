# Graded Assignment: Deploying a MERN Application on AWS

## Objective
Gain practical experience in deploying a MERN stack application on AWS using infrastructure automation with **Terraform** and configuration management with **Ansible**.

> [!NOTE]
> **MERN Application Repository:** [TravelMemory on GitHub](https://github.com/UnpredictablePrashant/TravelMemory)

## Tasks

### Part 1: Infrastructure Setup with Terraform

1. **AWS Setup and Terraform Initialization**
   - Configure AWS CLI and authenticate with your AWS account.
   - Initialize a new Terraform project targeting AWS.

2. **VPC and Network Configuration**
   - Create an AWS VPC with two subnets: one public and one private.
   - Set up an Internet Gateway and a NAT Gateway.
   - Configure route tables for both subnets.

3. **EC2 Instance Provisioning**
   - Launch two EC2 instances: one in the public subnet (for the web server) and another in the private subnet (for the database).
   - Ensure both instances are accessible via SSH (public instance only accessible from your IP).

4. **Security Groups and IAM Roles**
   - Create necessary security groups for web and database servers.
   - Set up IAM roles for EC2 instances with required permissions.

5. **Resource Output**
   - Output the public IP of the web server EC2 instance.

### Part 2: Configuration and Deployment with Ansible

1. **Ansible Configuration**
   - Configure Ansible to communicate with the AWS EC2 instances.

2. **Web Server Setup**
   - Write an Ansible playbook to install Node.js and NPM on the web server.
   - Clone the MERN application repository and install dependencies.

3. **Database Server Setup**
   - Install and configure MongoDB on the database server using Ansible.
   - Secure the MongoDB instance and create necessary users and databases.

4. **Application Deployment**
   - Configure environment variables and start the Node.js application.
   - Ensure the React frontend communicates with the Express backend.

5. **Security Hardening**
   - Harden the security by configuring firewalls and security groups.
   - Implement additional security measures as needed (e.g., SSH key pairs, disabling root login).

## Deliverables

Your final submission must include:
- [ ] **Terraform Scripts** for AWS infrastructure setup.
- [ ] **Ansible Playbooks** for configuration and deployment of the MERN application.
- [ ] **Detailed Report** documenting the implementation process, including how the application components interact with each other and the infrastructure.
- [ ] **Demonstration** (Screenshots or a video recording) showing the working MERN application.
